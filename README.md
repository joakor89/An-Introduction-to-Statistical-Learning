# An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python

Data Science, while inherently intricate, is fundamentally the art of uncovering patterns and insights from information. As the field evolves, the ability to quantify and interpret the uncertainty of predictions becomes increasingly critical, especially in probabilistic machine learning models.

This repository is dedicated to advancing my own understanding and application of prediction uncertainty through the lens of conformal prediction. Built upon the principles and exercises outlined in the highly regarded book “ by  (2023), it provides a structured exploration of this essential framework.

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a practical and comprehensive resource for my own seeking to deepen the knowledge in this area. By offering detailed explanations, solutions, and insights derived from the book, it aims to empower practitioners and learners alike to confidently apply conformal prediction techniques in real-world scenarios.

### Additional GitHub Commands
if you already created your repository, then:
```sh
1. git remote add origin ["copy here ssh or https"] 
2. same procedure applied above
3. Note: if you already got your ReadMe.md & License.md then,
firstly request your git pull origin master. THIS IS ALWAYS A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE.
4. git push origin master
```
